## Hi there~ ðŸ‘‹
I am a mathematics graduate with a passion of decomposing complexity and establishing relationships in data. I had diverse opportunities abroad as a pharmaceutical research intern in Tokyo, Japan to teaching English to elementary-grade students in Daejeon, South Korea. These experiences not only broadened my perspective but highlighted the importance of utilizing data to help drive actionable, impactful solutions.

I recently completed LearningFuze's Data and Infrastructure Program, where I honed my data analysis and technical skills. Currently, these repositories are a work of progress. 

Besides data projects, I enjoy exploring fashion trends, sharpening my coding skills, or discovering ways to re-interpret things mathematically. Please feel free to check out my projects~
